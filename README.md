---

## 1. What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of **machine learning** where the model is **not given any labels**. Instead, it tries to **find patterns, structures, or relationships** in the input data **without any human supervision**.

### Analogy:

> Imagine you walk into a library in a foreign country. You don't understand the language, and the books aren't labeled. But you start grouping books by cover color, size, or paper texture. That's unsupervised learning ‚Äî you find patterns **without anyone telling you what each book is about**.

---

## 2. Key Features of Unsupervised Learning

* No labeled outputs.
* The system **learns patterns** from raw data.
* Focuses on **data exploration** and **dimensionality reduction**.

---

## 3. Main Types of Unsupervised Learning

### a. Clustering

Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity.

### b. Dimensionality Reduction

Reducing the number of input variables while preserving key information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).

---

## 4. Clustering ‚Äì The Most Common Task

###  What is Clustering?

Clustering is the process of **grouping similar data points** together such that:

* Points in the same cluster are **very similar**.
* Points in different clusters are **very different**.

#### Analogy:

> Think of a **fruit market**. Without labels, you still group bananas together, oranges together, and apples together based on color, shape, and size ‚Äî that's clustering.

---

## 5. Common Clustering Algorithms

### 1. K-Means Clustering

* K: number of clusters to form
* Algorithm tries to find **K centroids** (central points)
* Assigns each data point to the **nearest centroid**

#### Example:

Group people into **3 clusters** based on their income and spending habits:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Income': [45, 54, 67, 120, 130, 150],
    'Spending': [50, 60, 65, 90, 85, 95]
})

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(data)

print("Cluster centers:\n", kmeans.cluster_centers_)
print("Labels:", kmeans.labels_)
```

#### Analogy:

> Imagine you're organizing guests at a wedding into tables. You want guests with **similar interests** to sit together. You decide in advance how many tables (K) you want, then keep adjusting who sits where until everyone feels comfortable ‚Äî that‚Äôs K-means!

---

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering

* Doesn‚Äôt require you to specify the number of clusters
* Creates a **tree of clusters (dendrogram)**
* You can "cut" the tree at any level to decide how many clusters you want

#### Example:

Grouping animals based on shared characteristics.

#### Types:

* **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)**: Start with individual points and merge them
* **Divisive (Top-Down)**: Start with one cluster and split

#### Analogy:

> Think of **family genealogy**. Starting from yourself (a single person), you connect to your siblings, then to your parents, then grandparents ‚Äî forming a hierarchy.

---

## 6. Dimensionality Reduction ‚Äì Finding Simplicity in Complexity

###  1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Reduces many variables into **fewer** that still capture most of the information.
* Helps visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

#### Analogy:

> Imagine having a thick book written in 5 languages. You want to summarize it in just 1 or 2 pages without losing much of the message. That‚Äôs what PCA does with data.

#### Example:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

print("Reduced shape:", reduced.shape)
```

## 7. When to Use Unsupervised Learning?

* You have **no labels** or **cannot label data** easily.
* You want to **explore data** or **discover hidden patterns**.
* You want to **segment users**, **detect anomalies**, or **preprocess data** for supervised learning.

| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| E-commerce    | Customer segmentation           |

| Social Media  | Community detection in networks |
| NLP           | Topic modeling                  |

## 9. Pros and Cons of Unsupervised Learning

### Pros

* Works without labels
* Reveals hidden patterns
* Good for exploratory analysis

###  Cons

* Hard to evaluate accuracy
* Might find patterns that **don‚Äôt make sense**
* No ground truth for validation

---

## 10. How to Evaluate Unsupervised Models?

Since there are **no labels**, evaluation is tricky.

### For Clustering:

* **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster vs others.
* **Inertia** (K-Means): Sum of distances from points to cluster center (lower is better).
* **Dendrogram analysis** (Hierarchical): Visual check.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create dummy dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': [25, 30, 45, 35, 50, 23, 40],
    'Income': [30000, 40000, 50000, 45000, 80000, 32000, 60000]
})

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(df)

# Plot clusters
plt.scatter(df['Age'], df['Income'], c=df['Cluster'], cmap='rainbow')
plt.xlabel('Age')
